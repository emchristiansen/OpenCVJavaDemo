A demo of the Java wrapper for OpenCV with two examples: 1) feature detection and matching and 2) face detection. The examples are coded in Scala, but anyone familiar with Java should be able to read them. Please feel free to contribute code examples in Scala or Java.

To run the examples:
1) Install OpenCV and copy the OpenCV jar to lib/. This jar must match the native libraries installed in your system. If this isn't the case, you may get a java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError at runtime.

2) Install SBT (http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

3) Go to the root directory and type "sbt run". This should generate images in your current directory.
